This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Then, the following were added:
* redux
* react-redux
* redux-promise

Project folder organization follows a pattern described at [https://medium.com/lexical-labs-engineering/redux-best-practices-64d59775802e#.p35q8cgdh]

(if you don't have yarn, `brew install yarn`)
